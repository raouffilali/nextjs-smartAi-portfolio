          I&apos;m a full-stack web developer specializing in{" "}
          <strong className="text-primary">React</strong>,{" "}
          <strong className="text-primary">Next.js</strong>,{" "}
          <strong className="text-primary">Angular</strong>,

        </p>
        <p>
          I also have some experience with{" "}
          <strong className="text-primary">Android development</strong> using{" "}
          <strong className="text-primary">Flutter</strong>, but have stopped
          working with it a few years ago. I prefer web development because you
          can use a modern website on almost every device and reach the whole
          world with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring a versatile background to the table, having excelled in{" "}

          <strong className="text-primary">web design</strong> before
          transitioning to full-stack development. My experience in crafting
          compelling user interfaces and seamless experiences has equipped me
          with a unique perspective. This journey has allowed me to seamlessly
          integrate design thinking into my development work, resulting in a
          holistic and effective approach to creating digital solutions.

        <H2>Hobbies</H2>
        <p>
          Besides programming, I love doing sports. I lift weights and do
          Kick-Boxing and muay thai . I also enjoy entending Tech events,
          reading books and going out sometimes. I think having hobbies other
          than coding is important for mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m also very much into self-improvement, nutrition, and positive
          psychology.
